         <h1>Prelim MT5 &#43; Python interface for Algo-trading</h1>
         <p>Algorithmic Trading is allegedly fairly common, however almost kept behind lock and key for the majority of the non-technical public. Retail Traders appear to focus more on rather manual trading strategies. I love automation. So lets take a crack at it.</p>
<p>In the past I&rsquo;ve come across a fair few Graduate roles and general Jobs centered around Data Science/Engineering for Automated trading algorithms. First off I think there&rsquo;s some contraints to be defined here. I&rsquo;ll be focusing my endevours with a focus on Forex and financial markets, as I know the most about these. They&rsquo;re the most liquid and highly volatile also, and i don&rsquo;t really enjoy fancy testing a longer term algorithm from the get go!</p>
<p>Worth mentioning, this is just a blog, not financial advise, so don&rsquo;t take it as such, and don&rsquo;t repeat my steps. If you do so, you do it at your own risk.</p>
<h2 id="statement-of-intentions">Statement of Intentions.</h2>
<p>I intend on making this space a relatively unspecific catalogue of proejcts undergone. I had a few ideas of things to try that could be fun to document, and hence have created this space to do exactly that!</p>
<p>Hopefully the overhead in writing a post is not tooooo high, but I have attempted to automate what i can to reduce said overhead! Thank you hugo, and Github Pages.</p>
<p>I did also dabble with using Wordpress for this blog, but the page loadtimes would definitely take a hit with the advantage of ease of use, and the ability to write posts via a mobile device.</p>
<h3 id="intended-outcome">Intended outcome</h3>
<p>I desire to create an automated trading algorithm which can be run, and opens and closes positions on the financial markets based on it&rsquo;s own analyis. The strategy which I will be focusing on is a Break and Retest support/resistance of a pair such as GBP/USD. This is a common strategy used by Retail traders with a more technical trading influence, in this case, the algorithm will have no bearing on current events surrounding the market, and so would be considered purely technical.</p>
<h3 id="background-knowledge">Background Knowledge</h3>
<p>Two things which will help this endevour are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Programming Skill</li>
<li>Trading Skill</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="programming-skill">Programming Skill</h3>
<p>I have a decent grasp on Python as the language of choice, having studied it formally for A Level, as well as using it in a professional environment as the scripting language of choice for anything that requires API access. I&rsquo;ve also spend a good portion of time debugging production grade Flask web servers in a professional environment. I reckon i can pick up anything required in a reasonably quick amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="trading-skill">Trading Skill</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m by no means a professional retail forex trader, however I have watched a fair few Trading Nut podcast (would recommend!), and completed the MissionFX trading course by Nick Shawn. I also did my fair share of practising a technical trading algorithm (the one I intend to automate here), inspired heavilly by the good Ser Nick Shawn&rsquo;s work, as well as taking some guidance from other traders on YouTube I&rsquo;ve seen through the years. With my background in development, when doing the trading course, the thing that was always in the back of my mind was, &ldquo;Man, surely this can be automated&rdquo;.</p>
<h3 id="initial-research">Initial research</h3>
<p>There are a plentiful supply of APIs available for accessing the Forex markets&rsquo; historical and realtime data.</p>
<p>There is also an interface module for Metatrader 5 (MT5) for Python.</p>
<p>I am fairly familiar with MT4, since I used it for backtesting the strategy taught by MissionFX. It also has a handy dandy mobile applicaion for monitoring open positions.</p>
<p>If we go down the API route, ideally an API which is created by a broker would be best, since we want to be making trades based on the same information as the analysis. IG markets&rsquo; appears to be widely used. I also came across the <a href="https://apilayer.com/marketplace/currency_data-api?txn=free&amp;live_demo=show">Currency Data API</a> which looks promising and easy to use, however there is a cost attributed with both based on the number of requests. Visualising data from an API as well as currently open trades would be a task in itself. And so the option of MT5 seems more and more appealing.</p>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Open up a broker account/demo account with a broker. Likely IC markets, as I&rsquo;m most familiar with them, and they offer a spreadbetting account in the UK which has tax benefits.</li>
<li>Install Python3 and MT5 module</li>
<li>Write initial test script to have Python able to interact with MT5</li>
<li>Get trading data from MT5</li>
<li>Open test positions in Demo Account</li>
</ol>
